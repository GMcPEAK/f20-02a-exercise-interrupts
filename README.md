# Polling, Interrupts, and DMA

Welcome to `faux_s` (pronounced "OS") which is a fake OS running on Linux.
You're going to use `faux_s` as a test-bed to understand

1. the trade-offs between polling and interrupts, and
2. the trade-off between byte-by-byte reading of data, and DMA.

It emulates two devices, a boop generator, and a meme generator.

Two subsequent days of exercises will use `faux_s` to investigate these two issues.

Simple `make` comments include:

- `make` to build everything
- `make build` ditto
- `make clean` to remove all generated files

## `faux_s` Design

`faux_s` has a number of components:

- **Interrupts** - `faux_interrupts.c` includes logic to emulate an interrupt controller that contains a vector of Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs).
    It uses Linux `signal`s to emulate interrupts.
	Signals, like interrupts, stop whatever is currently executing, and use their stack for signal execution (similar to if kernel code is executing when an interrupt arrives).
- **Devices** - `faux_dev.c` emulates a few devices.
	The devices that current work are the *boop device* which creates Penny boops, and the *meme device* which spits out random memes.
	Each device has a register we can *write* into which controls how frequently the boops and memes arrive, and a register that can be *read*.
	The latter gives us the data in the device!
	This can be the characters of the boop, or the characters of the meme.
	The function `faux-s_dev_reg_read` is well documented, and you should read and understand its signature.
	`faux_s` creates a lot of overhead for each read to a device to *emulate* the large costs of going out to I/O.
- **DMA** - `faux_dma.c` includes a simple DMA interface (that essentially uses a "ring" with a single entry).
	The interface enables an OS to enqueue a new, empty buffer that the device will later populate.
	Then the OS can dequeue that populated buffer and process the data.

The different *modes* of execution for the code can be toggled in the `#define`s at the top of `main.c`.

You should read through `main.c` to get the gist of most of it.

## Exercises: Polling vs. Interrupts

You're going to run the code in two configurations:

1. Using polling to get device data.
	This makes sure that `#define POLL_IO` is not commented out.
	You can run the program for the boop device (`#define BOOPDEV` uncommented), and for the meme device.
2. With polling disabled, instead using interrupts.
	In this configuration, the `dev_isr` will receive periodic activations from your device!

You should be able to get by mostly only knowing the code in `main.c`.
Please answer the following questions:

- **Q1:** What happens when you run the system using polling?
	We see that about one out of 5 units of work are one of the characters of "BOOP" @ 60 Boops/minute
- **Q2:** What happens when you run the system using interrupts?
	About one out of 25 units of work are used to print one of the characters of "BOOP" @ 60 Boops/minute
- **Q3:** How can you explain the difference?
	In lines 78-93, we read the device register for boops every loop, which has a high time cost since checking the device register is an expensive operation, and most of the time, there is no data, meaning it is essentially wasting processing time.
- **Q4:** A famous google interview question: How can you tell by which way a stack grows in C on your architecture?
	Brainstorm this as a group and test it out.
		The stack grows down, as seen by printing the addresses of 2 local variables in different functions (main.c:55)
	Use what you learned from that exercise to figure out which stack the interrupt handler `dev_isr` is executing on.
	Explain what you think is happening, and how that is possible?
	In other words: how are stacks used with signals in Linux?
		`dev_isr` executes on the same stack, as seen by the address of the local variable data declared at the beginning. Since a signal isn't an interrupt, but rather an emulated interupt, it uses the same stack as the function that called it.
	
- **Q5:** Use the meme device both modes.
	What is happening here?
	It prints out a lot of gibberish, parts of memes.
	What solutions do you foresee?
	We need to find a way to stop the memes from interrupting themselves, otherwise our memes will simply be dreams.
		

Now lets hack in some DMA!

- **Q1:** Only the meme device provides DMA.
	Why?
		The boop device only sends one byte of data, rather than many, so DMA does not provide much of a benefit
	Why does DMA make more sense for the meme device?
		A meme is many bytes that should all be read at the same time to make sense, which is why DMA is beneficial.

- **Q2:** Not so much a question as a puzzle:
	Implement the `main.c` code to use the DMA features of the meme device!
	Note that there is a lot of documentation of the DMA functions.
- **Q3:** Why does DMA have such an impact here?
	The constant `WORK_AMNT` in `faux_dev.c` changes the simulated latency of the interconnect used to "talk" to the device.
	How does changing `WORK_AMNT` impact the effectiveness of DMA?
	What does this mean for non-simulated systems?
- **Q4:** Does your implementation pass `valgrind`^[Note, you might need to `apt-get install valgrind`]?
	Valgrind is a tool that helps you debug your C.
	It detects errors in using `malloc` and `free`; double freeing a piece of memory? not freeing memory?

## A Note on `gdb`

If you want to use `gdb` with programs that use frequent signals, and wish to avoid it reporting every signal, use:

```
(gdb) handle SIGUSR1 noprint nostop
```
